# **Rule 1**
---
> There might be some people who seem racist and Anti-LGBTQ+, but please know that this server is here for people with clashing opinions to have a civil debate/discussion, and therefore we try to support freedom of speech to the logical extent. We also don't support racism.  If you ever and yes I mean ever, feel uncomfortable with a user please notify one of the non-partisan moderators with the following information; User ID, Message, Message Link, and Reasoning for the Report. Please note that a report is not meant for you to block people with differing beliefs. The report feature should exclusively be used if a person violates any rule or makes you feel unsafe. Anyone who abuses the report feature will receive a warn, the report will be discarded. Frequent abusers of the report feature will be banned.
---
### Reasoning for the rule: we want to keep a safe debating environments, with that we needed to keep everyone safe in the process. Keeping people safe is our top priority.
---
# **Rule 2**
---
> Rule 2 is meant for toxicity or reasons for reporting a fellow member of the Debaters server. Any questions or outliers of Rule 2 and any other rule can be discussed in the "Discussing-rules" text channel. We try to encourage civil debates so please limit swearing, yelling, and name-calling. If a debater is excessively violating previously mentioned Anti-civil speech you may submit a report and any evidence you might have (refer to rule 4). Keep in mind that this rule is heavily based on the opinion of "hate speech" and not every instance will be flagged due to the moderator's own opinion. Also, keep in mind that we trust all our moderators heavily, so their word is final. You may submit a report against a moderator for being non-partial. Don't expect any fast results because we need to submit a report against a moderator to the head admin or owner. 
---
### Reasoning for the rule; we support free speech to its logical extent. Key-word being, logical. There are exceptions to free speech that we want to restrict. 
---
# **Rule 3**
---
> Discrimination of any kind is prohibited and a violator can easily be flagged or banned. This is extremely rude and is against what the Debaters server stands for. Discrimination includes race, age, gender, opinion, or sexuality unless that is the accepted debate topic by both parties. You can submit a report with any evidence you might have (refer to rule 4). 
---
### Reasoning for the rule: put reasoning here.
---
# **Rule 4**
---
> **Privacy**. Please keep in mind that you maybe recorded for any reason, including no reason, by any person. This maybe for the safety of both debaters, and or the users of the server. We strongly recommend that you record each debate for moderation purposes and possibly to show your friends and to learn what you did wrong/right during the debate.
---
### Reasoning for the rule: this is to make hard evidence against people so that moderators don't have to believe one side over the other.
---
# **Rule 5**
---
> You aren't allowed to change debate topic(s) unless accepted by all parties of the debate. Violators of rule 5 will receive a warning and the closing of the voice channel.
---
### Reasoning for the rule: this helps accept everyone's full opinion and to help the moderators better understand what is going on in the server.
