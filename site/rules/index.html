Any questions or outliers of Rule 2 and any other rule can be discussed in the "Discussing-rules" text channel. We try to encourage civil debates so please limit swearing, yelling, and name-calling. If a debater is excessively violating previously mentioned Anti-civil speech you may submit a report and any evidence you might have (refer to rule 4). Keep in mind that this rule is heavily based on the opinion of "hate speech" and not every instance will be flagged due to the moderator's own opinion. Also, keep in mind that we trust all our moderators heavily, so their word is final. You may submit a report against a moderator for being non-partial. Don't expect any fast results because we need to submit a report against a moderator to the head admin or owner.</h2>
